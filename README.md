## Overview

The project contains several simulations demonstrating the application of Kalman Filters in tracking the state of planes over time. Different scenarios, including varying noise levels, state malfunctions, and landmark localization, are explored.

## Features

- **Kalman Filter Simulation**: Simulates the Kalman Filter for plane state estimation.
- **Extended Kalman Filter**: Includes an extended version of the Kalman Filter for more complex scenarios.
- **Noise Analysis**: Analyzes the impact of different noise levels on the filter's performance.
- **Landmark Localization**: Simulates plane localization using landmarks and the extended Kalman Filter.
- **3D and 2D Plotting**: Visualizes the state estimation and actual state of planes in both 3D and 2D.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scipy**: For statistical functions and optimizations.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive plots.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
